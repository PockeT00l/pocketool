*Pocketool* is a discord.py rewrite bot, made for utility. It's (planned) features are (projected to have) serverinfo, userinfo, roleinfo, basic moderation, server creation and management commands and templates, and raid protection.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Currently, the bot is in beta.  with basic commands, im not expecting it to get servers fast.
**At the time of this commit, the bot is in _closed_ beta, meaning only i can add it to servers should they apply for beta.**

I, 'EEK', do not claim responsibility for any damage(s) caused by the bot - the code (and usage of the bot) are used at your own risk.

*with the bot being in beta, i haven't posted the code. it will be released at open beta, or if the [server's poll](https://discord.gg/gmvNT4Y) says to make it OS now.*
