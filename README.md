# pocketool code
yes, this is the code. please be aware you will need to get a token from [this site](https://discordapp.com/developers/applciations) and put it in `token=` for your bot to run.
please note i don't really want people running this themselves, so just take a look at [cogs](https://github.com/EEKIM10/pocketool/tree/code/pock/coggable). i wont provide support for running.
